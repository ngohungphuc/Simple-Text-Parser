I would like to request your investment paper offer.

It is a true disappointment to see you closing the Trend Following newsletter.
Given the current media environment in the USA, good and reliable opinions and points-of-view are hard to come by.
It seems everybody wants to put their particular spin on whatever they publish.
You, however, have no problem stating the facts as you have discovered them and allowing the reader to come to their own conclusions.
If/when you ever decide to attempt something like this again, please let me know.
