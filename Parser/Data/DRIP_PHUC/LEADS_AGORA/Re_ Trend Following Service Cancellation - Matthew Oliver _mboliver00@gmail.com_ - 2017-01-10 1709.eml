Mr. Covel,

Thank you for the effort you're taking to take care of your now former
Agora subscribers!  I've only just begun to learn more about how to use
Trend Following to my advantage and I very much appreciate your desire to
help all of us learn more!

I do have some questions about using volatility-based trailing stops.  I've
read about them on Investopedia and other places, but I think those
introductions lack some useful information on how to properly calculate and
apply them to my portfolio.

I've read about using the ATR times 2 or 3, plus the low (or high).  For
which time period is the ATR based on?  Why times two, or three?  Gann
Angles (still don't really understand that)?  Yikes!

Do you have a resource that better describes how you, or other 'pro's',
construct these stops?

I know your very busy, so thanks for taking the time to read my email!
Matt Oliver
