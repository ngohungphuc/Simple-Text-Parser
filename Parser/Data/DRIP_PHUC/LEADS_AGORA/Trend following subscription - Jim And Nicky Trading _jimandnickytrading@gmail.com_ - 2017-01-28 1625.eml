Hi Michael,
I've sadly been informed by Agora that, without any warning, you have  disco=
ntinued your Trend Following newsletter.=20
Does this mean we get a refund? After all we paid for your services in good f=
aith and had 365 days to decide if it was right for us or not. I only joined=
 in September so technically I had another 8 months before I made a decision=
, a decision which has now been taken away from me. It seems very unfair if w=
e don't get a refund, after all it's not as if you'd gone bust or anything.
I have written to Agora of course but as usual have had no reply as yet ( al=
though to be fair they usually take a few days respond to my email and then i=
t is only to say how busy they are and will respond properly when they can )=
.

Since I'm not asking about financial investment advice I take it you can act=
ually reply to this email and I look forward to hearing from you.=20

Sincerely
Jim Crossman
