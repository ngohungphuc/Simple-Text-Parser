Dear Michael,

Thank you so much for your insightful 'Trend Following' newsletter and
podcasts of the past year. I had a lifetime Trend Following subscription
with Agora, and was unpleasantly surprised this week that it had come to a
premature end. Especially since your portfolio recommendations did rather
well for me while some of my other subscriptions to Agora have resulted in
significant losses so far.

You really got me hooked to the concept of trend following. So much so that
I am reading your book 'The Complete TurtleTrader', so I can apply its
principles to my investments in the local (Dutch / European) market.

I would very much like to receive the investment paper you mentioned in
your goodbye message. I would prefer to receive it by email, but if you
ship only physical copies my name and address are:

E.L. ten Kulve
Karveel 34-07
Lelystad, 8231 BL
Netherlands


Best regards,
Evan ten Kulve
