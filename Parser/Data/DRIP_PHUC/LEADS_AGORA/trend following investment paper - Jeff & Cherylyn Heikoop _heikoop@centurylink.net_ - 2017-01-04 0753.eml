Hi, Michael.  Sorry to hear about the termination of your Agora 
services.  I was a lifetime member of Trend Following and a member of 
Vertical Trades.  I have enjoyed your insights and would be interested 
in your investment paper.

On a related note, I realize that you can't offer specific investment 
advice, but do you have any general advice for the retail investor when 
it comes to trend following?  I just don't have the time right now to 
learn the system that you offer on your website, which is why I valued 
your service through Agora so much.  Maybe when I'm not working 12 hour 
days...

I'm aware of GMOM, which you pointed out in the early days of your 
services (thank-you), the Equinox Chesapeake fund based on Jerry 
Parker's work (I really enjoyed your Turtle Traders book), and I have 
looked at the funds in Tim Price's recent book on your recommendation.  
The funds in Price's book, however, seem to be for accredited or high 
net worth investors.  Do any of your trend following colleagues manage 
funds for retail investors?

Thanks again for your insight.  I will miss your service. Keep up the 
good fight.  After the 'Trump Bump' I don't know how anyone can believe 
in macro predictions any more.....

Take care,

Jeff
