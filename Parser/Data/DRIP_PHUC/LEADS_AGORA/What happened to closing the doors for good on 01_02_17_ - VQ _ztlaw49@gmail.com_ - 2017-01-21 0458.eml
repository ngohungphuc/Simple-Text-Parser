Hello,
I am Victoria Quijada and I subscribed to your newsletter this year.
I received your e-mail on 01/02/17 stating that Trend Investments
newsletter would cease effective immediately.  I was also promised for
being a supporter of your newsletter, I'd receive a lifetime subscription
in Rude Awakening, which I subscribe to also.  I have not received notice
from Rude Awakening that my membership has been converted to a lifetime
membership.  I continue to be billed monthly $50 for that service.

However I have continued to receive daily e-mails since then from
Agora/Trend Investments.

Please advise what has happened so that these newsletters continue.
I look forward to your reply.

Thank you.
Victoria Quijada
