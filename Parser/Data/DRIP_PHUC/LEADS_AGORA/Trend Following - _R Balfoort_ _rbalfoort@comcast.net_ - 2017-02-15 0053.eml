Hi Michael.  I also left a voice message so note that you need not give =
a duo response.  I was very happy with your T.S. newsletter and was =
disappointed when you cancelled same.  I dod not like the replacement.  =
Are you going to come up with a replace?  If not can I request a refund? =
 I have subscribed to many stock newsletters, and T.F. was the only one =
that made sense.  Thanks.   Bob Balfoort
