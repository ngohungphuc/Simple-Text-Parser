Hi Michael,

Learnt *a*lot* on trading from the subscription. Even apply Trend
following to my relationships and love life :-) I highly recommend
it to everyone. No more endless wasted time on WhatsApp or
conversations. ...In financials term my return on bitcoin trading shot
up by leaps and bounds because to trend following. ..Cant remember any
successful options trade from the subscription though. 

The rude awaking pro I already have. Not to exited about it. Vertical
Trade never worked because Saxo bank doesn't carry the options. 

Love to expend my knowlegde on trend following. Work it all in the
algorithms I develop for bitcoins trading. Bitcoins exhanges is no bull
shit. Trend followers have to love crypto trading and the other away
around. 

Last word, will someone actually read this email or will some AI just
parse out my address than scrap it and spam me with up-sell ploys for
years to come. 
 

Take care, 
Michael Meelis
