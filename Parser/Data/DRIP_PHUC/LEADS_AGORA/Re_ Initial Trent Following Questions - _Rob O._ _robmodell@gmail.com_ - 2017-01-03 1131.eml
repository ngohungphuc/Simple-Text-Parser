Hey Michael,

The Trade_Walk_Through was fantastic. Seeing that end to end with the notes
made some new things click for me. The main rule for drawdown also lays
things out well. I understand.

After reviewing the "Portfolio_Instrument_Examples", I have a better
understanding of what a possible portfolio mix looks like. I also realize
I'll need to review the section on correlation before getting in to 2nd and
3rd markets. However, I'm still not certain on where to begin researching
trends for my first trade.

Do I simply pick a market from 1_portfolio_for_example_purposes.png and get
started looking for trends, or do you have a suggested beginning?

I did a little research and found good reviews of "Generic Trade". Do you
have a recommended platform? (I'm assuming it varies depending on what
you're trading?)

All the best,
Rob
