Dear Michael,=20

I am disappointed and quite surprised to see the end of your newsletter =
with Agora Financial. It seems like there is a high turnover at Agora =
which leaves me worrying since I have a couple of other subscriptions. =
Anyway, I have enjoyed your book, newsletter, and podcasts over the last =
few months (I subscribed back in July). I did follow a couple of =
recommendations (EXAS and EVH) in the portfolio which did not do well, =
but I didn=E2=80=99t mind taking a couple of small losses. I was more =
interested in learning about Trend Following.   I am not a sophisticated =
or accredited investor and I handle a small account, but I do want to =
become a better and successful investor - and trend following is a =
mindset, philosophy, or style of investing that I want to understand and =
use as a tool to succeed with my investments.

Hope to hear from you and have a continued connection with Trend =
Following.=20

Enrique
