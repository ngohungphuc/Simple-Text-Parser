Thanks, Mr. Covel for the =E2=80=9Cheads-up.=E2=80=9D   Sorry to see the =
end of your Trend Following newsletter.  I followed it religiously in a =
non-investing manner as a learning experience.  The notion of investing =
in good companies which are trending in one direction or the other is =
appealing to me, and, most importantly, makes good sense.  I will try to =
use it on my own for a while without committing money to it.  If I am =
able to use it well enough, I=E2=80=99ll invest almost exclusively with =
the system.  To whatever  extent a stock=E2=80=99s price is a reflection =
of  the fundamentals of a given company, it is so much easier for an 85 =
year old guy to follow a trend than to attempt to evaluate the =
fundamentals.  Certainly, they do impact the value of a stock, but each =
metric may not be weighted he same as every other one.  Too much for =
this old guy to handle.

Good luck to you in your next endeavor.

DW Sperry, M.D.=
