Hi Mike
          About last Nov 1 I purchased a lifetime membership. This was =
based in the large part on you being behind the program. That was two =
months prior to your announcement that you had left.
On this basis would you be able to arrange a refund of my subscription =
fee of $1500.=20
     I have followed you and your work for some time and look forward to =
continue Reading your work and following your recommendations.
    Thank you so much for your attention to this matter.=
