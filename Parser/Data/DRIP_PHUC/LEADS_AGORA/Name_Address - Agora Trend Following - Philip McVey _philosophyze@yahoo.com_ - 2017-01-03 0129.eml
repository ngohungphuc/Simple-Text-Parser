Michael,=C2=A0
Sorry to see you go! I'll definitely keep following you. The insights I've =
gained from your work via Agora are invaluable.
It's inspired me to start building my own trading system using MultiCharts.=
NET. I'm learning how to create new analysis indicators and signals that th=
e system doesn't have built in so I can generate a dashboard.=C2=A0
Eventually my goal is to automate my system. Rule #1... don't lose money (d=
efault behavior if the system doesn't know what to do) You've got to know y=
our stop loss before you start=C2=A0and follow the trends as far as they go=
!=C2=A0I wish I had understood risk management in trading earlier but it's =
never too late!=C2=A0
I followed a lot of well meaning advice but your insight that the complexit=
y of the market makes it impossible to predict was brought home after Trump=
 won. I had bet big (for me) that he would and expected a payday the follow=
ing day with my volitility trade... but the "market" "recovered" overnight.=
 Regardless of the cause, I was wrong and it was right. Fair or not.
I also really appreciated the chapter on Simplicity in your book and the in=
terview you transcribed. I work with Systems Engineers so complexity is par=
t of my world. I'm constantly told I'm over thinking it! I've gotten the au=
diobook and I'm going to listen to it next.=C2=A0
Best wishes and thanks!=C2=A0Philip
