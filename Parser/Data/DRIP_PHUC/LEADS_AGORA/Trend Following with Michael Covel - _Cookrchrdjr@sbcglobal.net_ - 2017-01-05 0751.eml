Hey Michael

I=E2=80=99m sending you this email to say how disappointed I am that Agora =
dumped Trend following with Michael Covel. I subscribed for a =E2=80=9Clife=
time subscription=E2=80=9D I didn=E2=80=99t think it would only last a coup=
le months.

However I learned a lot from you and your podcasts. I want to continue to l=
earn. You were by far the best subscription they had. But the show must go =
on. I get the general concept of trend following. What I=E2=80=99m trying t=
o learn is how to spot the best trends and buy signals and how to set prope=
r stop losses and proper exits on winning trades for a particular market. I=
=E2=80=99ve only been trading for about 7 months. I have so much to learn. =
But I don=E2=80=99t have 40 years to make it happen. I don=E2=80=99t expect=
 to get rich quick I need to grow my accounts so I can retire comfortably o=
r better.

  I like having someone give me recommendations but I also want to be somew=
hat independent. I like to learn and I don=E2=80=99t want to be a blind she=
ep. I=E2=80=99ve learned a lot about risk management and position sizing bu=
t I need to learn how to spot the best trades.=20

Unfortunately I don=E2=80=99t have a ton of capital but am absolutely certa=
in I have to invest in my education. I hope I can learn more from you in th=
e future.

Keep up the great work and a prosperous 2017

Disappointed but grateful

Richard Cook
