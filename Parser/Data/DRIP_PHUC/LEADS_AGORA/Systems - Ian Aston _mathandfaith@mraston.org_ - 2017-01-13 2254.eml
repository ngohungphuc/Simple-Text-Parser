Mr. Covel,

Been reading your writing and listening to your podcast for quite some 
time now.  Also, am an Agora Financial member.  Disappointed in the 
closing of your newsletter as I found it to be very worthwhile.

Questions:

1)  In terms of systems and expected performance, can you comment on the 
difference between what was being used in the newsletter versus what I 
will be learning/implementing with your systems research?

2)  Is it possible to begin with the standard package and upgrade to the 
flagship at a later date?

Thanks for all that you have contributed to my growth both as an 
investor and a person.

Ian Aston
