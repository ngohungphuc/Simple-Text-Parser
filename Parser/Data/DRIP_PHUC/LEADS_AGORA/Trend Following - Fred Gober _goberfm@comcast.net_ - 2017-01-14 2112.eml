When Trend Following 1st came out I followed your initial =
recommendations to buy ABX, HL etc. I logged a nice profit. Thinking you =
were an actual winning stategy unlike all the BS like Cash Clock/ =
Calander etc I invested in the initial Vertical Trade recommendations. =
Thinking these were your recommendations I invested about $50K, my =
initial Trend Following trades plus the gains and lost $50K. Not sure =
why you departed so quickly from Agora, but am interested to see your =
recommendations to see if your for real or just another hyped marketer.
Thank You,
Fred Gober=
