Hi Michael,

I just saw your post on the trendfollowing mastermind group. I'm not 
sure on the type of people you are after (eg people that are already 
making millions, or people that are trend followers and are after the 
types of groups as Ed Seykota hosts - mainly on psychology).

Depending on where the one is in Asia, and the frequency (eg once a 
month), Im happy to fly over for it. If it is once a month, I will fly 
over for sure to Asia. If you are after people that can get together 
every week or fortnight, I can get back in touch with you when I live 
closer to your mastermind locations. I completely respect that you may 
like to have the group attendees be there regularly to keep the dynamic 
stable.

In summary, I'm part of the Trading Tribe and organised the Charles 
Poliquin and Ed Seykota seminar in Dallas, Tx.

I program my strategies based on a trend trading strategy I have 
backtested and optimised. Im working my way reading every single book I 
can find on trend trading (and re-reading!), top trader interviews, 
understanding how they think, and studying past traders and formulating 
my own set of principles based on my own strengths/weaknesses. I was 
doing this at the same time as working at the bank.
  Last year I left the corporate world at a bank in Treasury to now full 
time trade, read, learn etc.. (At the bank I tested the software from 
the developers for a project where we are rewriting and re-designing our 
code and infrastructure so all the data transactions through the bank 
(about 70% of the Australian and NZ economy)  get through to who needs 
it at the bank quicker so the bank knows it's risk/liquidity position 
within an hour - rather than 3 days as it currently stands).

I started 'trading' 4 years ago but I would say in reality, it has only 
been the last 18 months where I started getting serious and making 
changes in my own psychology and trading, and getting educated and less 
ignorant about who I am as a trader and my behaviour and see how that 
translates to my trading success (and in life).

I would like to join a group where I can also help others. I dont know 
how yet! I found that until I was in the situation (as in the trading 
tribe), I didnt know how I could contribute until I saw where other 
people were stuck and it was a path that I had already worked through 
over the years. In the trading tribe, it was in things such as health, 
discipline, and relationships between people close to us.

If you are after a group that knows the economy inside out and stays up 
to date with the news and what is going on and has an opinion about what 
that means in the different markets, I will be out of my depth.  While I 
read a lot about what is going on for general knowledge and to try and 
understand how people react (psychology), I dont think I know enough to 
be able to contribute yet.

On the other hand, when I launch my next seminar and if Ed is interested 
in speaking again, I would like to get in touch with you to see if you 
are interested in joining us to speak. Either way I think our paths may 
cross again!

Speak soon,

Diana.
