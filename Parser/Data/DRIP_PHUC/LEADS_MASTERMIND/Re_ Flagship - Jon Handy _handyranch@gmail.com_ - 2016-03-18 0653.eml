Mike,
I sent my interest in the mastermind group earlier but never heard anything
back.  I'm still interested and I think I want to purchase Spino, Saurus
and updated Flagship.  Is there a link to pay on the site for this or can
you tell me how you want payment.
Secondly, will you send the information on the mastermind group?
Thanks
Jon Handy
